# YandexMapsMoscowTravellerExtension
### Little chrome extension which helps me "walk" on street views of Moscow

To add it to your browser you'll need to download all the files and then add it like any other extension  
To use it click on icon, it will instanly redirect you to a Yandex.Maps site, on a random place inside MKAD and put you into a street view if any (sometimes does not work)
